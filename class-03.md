# WE HAVE THREE KIND OF LISTS IN HTML :
- Ordered lists

## NESTED lists
### You can put a second list inside
an (li) element to create a sublist or nested list.

# Border, Margin & Padding
- Border
Every box has a border (even if
it is not visible or is specified to
be 0 pixels wide). The border
separates the edge of one box
from another.

- margin
Margins sit outside the edge
of the border. You can set the
width of a margin to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.
- padding
Padding is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.
Adding padding can increase the
readability of its contents

# ARRAYS
ARRAYS An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values
You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other.

## CREATING AN ARRAY
You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of the array).
The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. The values in the array do not need to be the same data type, so you can store a string, a number and a Boolean all in the same array.


## VALU ES IN ARRAYS
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).

-	ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY
-	NUMBER OF ITEMS IN AN ARRAY


# SWITCH STATEMENTS
A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
JavaScript can convert data types behind the scenes to complete an operation. This is known as type coercion


## TRUTHY & FALSY VALUES
Falsy values are treated as if they are fa 1 se. The table to the left shows a hi ghScore variable with a series of values, all of which are falsy.
Falsy values can also be treated as the number 0 .
Truthy values are treated as if they are true. Almost everything that is not in the falsy table can be treated as if it were true. Truthy values can also be treated as the number 1.

## CHECKING EQUALITY & EXISTENCE
 Because the presence of an object or array can be considered truthy, it is often used to check for the existence of an element within a page
Because of type coercion, the strict equality operators ===and ! == result in fewer unexpected values than ==and ! = do.
