### in the beginning its start with a little introduction  about HTML and explain the right way to code and write elements with  an opening tag and a closing tag , to learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go

The Evolution of HTML
Since the web was first created, there have
been several different versions of HTML and the one we are using noow days is HTML5
that released since 2000
Because there have been
several versions of HTML, each
web page should begin with a
DOCTYPE declaration to tell a
browser which version of HTML
the page is using


there are ID Attribute (just like in the last picture) and CLASS Attribute they allow you to identify particular elements.
There are some characters that are used in
and reserved by HTML code such as (<,>,&,",')



 ## HTML Layout

## Headers & Footers

The header and footer
elements can be used for:
* The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
* A header or footer for an
individual article or
section within the page.

## Navigation
The nav element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation

## Articles
The article element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.
This could be an individual
article or blog entry, a comment
or forum post, or any other
independent piece of content.

## ASIDES
The aside element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an article
element or not.
When it used inside an article
, it should contain information that is related to the
article but not essential to its
overall meaning. For example, a
pullquote or glossary might be
considered as an aside to the
article it relates to.


## Sections
The section element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.


## Heading Groups
The purpose of the hgroup
element is to group together a
set of one or more h1 through
h6 elements so that they are
treated as one single heading

## Figures
 It can be used
to contain any content that is
referenced from the main flow of
an article 
Examples of usage include:
● Images
● Videos
● Graphs
● Diagrams
● Code samples
● Text that supports the main
body of an article
#### The figure element should
also contain a figcaption
element which provides a text
decription for the content of
the elementthen


## Sectioning Elements (div)
(div) is the a container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way using CSS


# when you are creating a new website first thing you have to do is to ask yourself some questions like:
* Who is the Site For?
* Why People Visit YOUR Website?
* What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?
* What Information Your Visitors Need?
* How Often People Will Visit Your Site?


## then you have to Site Map
### after you know what needs to appear
on your site, you can start to organize the
information into sections or pages just like this 
![](https://www.atilus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sitemap.gif)

## then do WireFrames for your website 
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key
information that needs to go on each page of a
site. It shows the hierarchy of the information
and how much space it might require. like this

### Getting your message across using design
you have to organize and
prioritize the information to
communicate their message
and help users find what they're
looking for by :
* visual hierarchy

You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets
across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for (color , size , style)
* grouping and Similarity

When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements
into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a
design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved.

### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal
 To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 

Start with the big picture of what
you want to achieve, and break
that down into smaller steps. 

# OBJECTS & PROPERTIES
- OBJECTS (TH INGS)
Each object can have its own:
• Properties
• Events
• Methods
- PROPERTIES (CHARACTERISTICS)
Properties describe characteristics of the current
web page (such as the title of the page). 


# EVENTS
 programs are designed to do different
things when users interact with the computer in
different ways .

# METHODS 
Methods perform tasks associated with the
document currently loaded in the browser (such
as getting information from a specified element or
adding new content). 


# HOW A BROWSER SEES A WEB PAGE 
-  RECEIVE A PAGE AS HTML CODE
-  CREATE A MODEL OF THE PAGE AND STORE IT IN MEMORY
-  USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN
