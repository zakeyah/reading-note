# What is jQuery? 

_jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code._

# jQuery Dom

DOM stands for Document Object Model and is a mechanism for representing and interacting with your HTML, XHTML or XML documents. It allows you to navigate and manipulate your documents through a programming language, which in the browser will almost always be JavaScript. DOM navigation and manipulation using standard JavaScript can be pretty cumbersome,  jQuery provides DOM related methods, which make the process much easier.

## Why you need jQuery


-  The jQuery library is free.
- It's light. Since jQuery pushes content to the client, it therefore reduces the wait time for server response. Plus, it's smaller than Flash, so it results in smoother playbacks and less errors.
- It works anywhere. HTML5 is cross-browser compatible-it will work on any browser, mobile phone or tablet, and even on Apple devices.
- There's a low learning curve. Since it's based on plain old JavaScript, developers can learn jQuery fast.
- Finally, jQuery is SEO friendly and CSS3 compliant.
