 While using express, there are 4 major tags that you will need to understand;

1. <% %>: This is used to embed javascript codes that do return outputs e.g control flow, conditionals, variable declaration, include statements.

2. <%= %>: Used to embed code that is supposed to return and output the result of an expression/computation to the view (page) at run-time.
