# What is CSS Grid Layout?

- CSS layout method designed for the two-dimensional layout of items on a webpage or application. I have been working with the specification over the last five years.

- Grid Lines are the lines that make up the grid. These can be horizontal or vertical. We can refer to them by number, or by name.

- Grid Track is the space between two Grid Lines, either horizontal or vertical.

-  Grid Cell is the space between 4 Grid Lines. So it is the smallest unit on our grid that is available for us to place an item into. 

- Grid Area is any area on the Grid bound by four grid lines. It may contain a number of Grid Cells.
