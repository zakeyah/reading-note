# Diversity and Inclusion :

It's no secret that there is a pronounced gender gap in technology fields. In 2014, 70% of the employees at the top tech companies in Silicon Valley, such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter, were male. In technical roles, this phenomenon is even more pronounced; for example, only 10% of the technical workforce at Twitter is female.

Programming is fast becoming the most lucrative skill you can have in the modern world. According to a recent study conducted by Glassdoor, 11 of the 25 best-paying jobs are technology related, with an average earning potential of between $106,000 and $130,000 a year.

An American Association of University Women review of more than 380 studies from academic journals, corporations, and government sources found that more early exposure to engineering and computing among boys in school creates "more positive attitudes toward and interest in STEM subjects." By the time students now reach university, 20% of men plan to take on a career in engineering or computing. Among women, that number is just 5.8%. Women start out so far behind that they often can't catch up.

Though there are isolated examples of both vintage and contemporary computer advertising aimed at women, it is clear that the advertising narrative around women and technology needs to be more inclusive if the gender gap is going to close.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

Diversity efforts are most successful when they're driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. **Diverse teams are smarter and more creative**

**Diverse companies perform better**In a 2011 study of diversity in the top firms in Standard & Poor's Composite 1500 list, researchers found female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.

**Companies are losing out on great talent**
 Many tech companies pride themselves on creating environments where "the best idea wins." By attracting diverse candidates and designing interviewing processes that ensure a level playing field, companies have a better chance of ensuring the best idea is at the table. 

 **Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base**
 Walker & Company CEO Tristan Walker recently observed: "If more black people were building features or striking partnerships at Twitter, perhaps they'd have a great idea" for more effectively engaging black users.
