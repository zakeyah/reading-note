# How to think like a programmer
>“Everyone in this country should learn to program a computer, because it teaches you to think.” — Steve Jobs

## what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

*Here are the steps:*

1. Understand
#### Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them 

2. Plan
#### Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

3. Divide
#### Do not try to solve one big problem. break it into sub-problems. Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest.

4. Stuck?
#### Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. 
#### Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach
#### Research:  Google is your best friend.


## Practice
#### Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

**Practice. Practice. Practice.**

# 5 Whys
### The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.

*How to Use the 5 Whys*
1. Assemble a Team
2. Define the Problem
3. Ask the First "Why?"
4. Ask "Why?" Four More Times
5. Know When to Stop
6. Address the Root Cause(s)
7. Monitor Your Measures
