# Bearer Authorization


#### Write the following steps in the correct order
- Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
- Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
- Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
- Make a request to the third-party API endpoint
- Receive authorization code
- Make a request to the access token endpoint
- Receive access token

##### What can you do with an authorization code?
The only thing you can do with the authorization code is to make a request to get an access token

##### What can you do with an access token?
The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data. Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage.

##### What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
OAuth doesn’t share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers.

| ----------- | ----------- |
| Client ID | is a unique eight-digit number generated by the depository participants to easily identify their clients        |
| Client Secret      | Is a secret used by the OAuth Client to Authenticate to the Authorization Server. The Client Secret is a secret known only to the OAuth Client and the Authorization Server. Client Secret must be sufficiently random to not be guessable.        |
| Authentication Endpoint      |  is a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service .        |
| Access Token Endpoint      |  is where apps make a request to get an access token for a user.        |
| API Endpoint      | its a point at which an application program interface (API) -- the code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other -- connects with the software program        |
| Authorization Code      | is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token.        |
| Access Token      | is an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread. A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity.        |


### JWTs
A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a JSON object encoded as a long string. We use them to identify users. It’s similar to a passport or driver’s license. It includes a few public properties about a user in its payload. These properties cannot be tampered because doing so requires re-generating the digital signature.

- When the user logs in, we generate a JWT on the server and return it to the client. We store this token on the client and send it to the server every time we need to call an API endpoint that is only accessible to authenticated users.

- To generate JSON Web Tokens in an Express app use jsonwebtoken package.
