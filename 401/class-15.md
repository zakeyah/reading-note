# Trees
### Tree is a widely used abstract data type that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.
### A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.
### Types of trees:
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees
- K-ary Trees

### Binary Trees versus K-ary Trees
- Trees can have any number of children per node, but Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two
- If Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree
- K refers to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have
