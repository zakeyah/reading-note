# OAuth

## OAuth definition
OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. In authentication parlance, this is known as secure, third-party, user-agent, delegated authorization.


## OAuth examples
The simplest example of OAuth is when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon. You then click on the button linked to the other website, the other website authenticates you, and the website you were originally connecting to logs you on itself afterward using permission gained from the second website.

## How OAuth Works

Step 1 – The User Shows Intent
Step 2 – The Consumer Gets Permission
Step 3 – The User Is Redirected to the Service Provider
Step 4 – The User Gives Permission
Step 5 – The Consumer Obtains an Access Token
Step 6 – The Consumer Accesses the Protected Resource
