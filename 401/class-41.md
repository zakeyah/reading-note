# React Native

### React Native lets you create truly native apps and doesn't compromise your users' experiences. It provides a core set of platform agnostic native components like `View`, `Text`, and `Image` that map directly to the platformâ€™s native UI building blocks.

- With React, you can make components using either classes or functions. 

## Expo
- Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

## ExpoKit
- ExpoKit is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project -- one that you would normally create using Xcode, Android Studio, or `react-native init`.
