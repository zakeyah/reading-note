# AWS: Cloud Servers

### Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle
The request/response cycle traces how a user’s request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren’t working).

### Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC
Is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers .

### What does it mean to “deploy” an application?
Deploying your application means putting it on a Web server so that it can be used either through the Internet or an intranet.
