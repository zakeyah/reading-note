# Linked List

## What is a Linked List ?

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.
There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation

## There are three important parameters in linked lists head (the first node), current (the node that we are currently looking at), and next (the next node to the current one).


## Parts of a linked list
A linked list can be small or huge, but no matter the size, the parts that make it up are actually fairly simple. A linked list is made up of a series of nodes, which are the elements of the list.

## Big o
There are two major points to consider when thinking about how an algorithm performs: how much time it requires at runtime given how much time and memory it needs.
One way to think about Big O notation is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.
