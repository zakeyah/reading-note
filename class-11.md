# IMAGES
## Css provide a lot of rules that you can use the control the the appearance of your web page images . Let’s took about some of them:

### changing the images dimensions: there are two ways to do that.
1- by using the width and height attributes inside the img tag.

2- by giving the img tag a class name then specify the width and height values from css file.

### Aligning images: you can specify the place of the image(center , left, right) by two ways:
1- by using the text-align attribute inside the img tag and give it a value center

2- by giving the img tag a class name and then add a float value(left.right) inside the css file . in order to put the image at the center of the page , you have to use a display property and give it a value block.

### Background image: you can add a backgroung image to any part of the web page by using the background-image property followed by it’s URL
### Note that a backgroung image added , it is repeated by defualt to fill the whole specified part. In order not to allow the image repeat , you have to use the background-repeat propert and give it a value * no* . no-repeat property has also two other properties which are :
1- repeat-x: to repeat the image along x axis ( horizentally)

2- repeat-y : to repeat the image vertically

### Note that there is a property called backgroung-attachment which has two values:
1- fixed: The background image stays in the same position on the page.

2- scroll: The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

#### backgroung-postion property:When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.For example you can specify the value of this property to center top to put the image appear in the top middle of the page.
