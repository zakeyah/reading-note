# Where to Place Images in Your Code

-  in the middle of a paragraph
# Three Rules for Creating Images
- Save images in the right format
- Save images at the right size
- Use the correct resolution

### Image Resolution
Images created for the web should be saved at
a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file.

 Images appearing on computer
screens are made of tiny squares
called pixels. A small segment
of this photograph has been
magnified to show how it is
made up of pixels. The web
browsers on most desktop
computers display images at a
resolution of 72 pixels per inch
(ppi).

- Hue (Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue.)
- satuRatioN (Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.)
- BRiGHtNess (Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color. At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark)
