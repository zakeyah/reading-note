# Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.


## Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model for a specific problem. And a domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

# What's a Table?
A table represents information in a grid format.

#### The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects.
Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers
to one object, usually the object in which the function operates. 

### A FUNCTION IN GLOBAL SCOPE
When a function is created at the top level of a script
(that is, not inside another object or function), then it
is in the global scope or global context. 

### GLOBAL VARIABLES
All global variables also become properties of the
window object. so when a function is in the global
context, you can access global variables using the
window object, as well as its other properties

## arrays are objects
### In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
### JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
### String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
### methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
