## Styling Forms
CSS is commonly used to
control the appearance of form
elements. This is both to make
them more attractive and to
make them more consistent
across different browsers
 It is most common to style:
- Text inputs and text areas
- Submit buttons
- Labels on forms, to get the
form controls to align nicely
### X Table cells can have different borders and spacing in
### different browsers, but there are properties you can
### use to control them and make them more consistent.

## EVENT LISTENERS

-	Events are the browserâ€™s way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked).
-	Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.
-	When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.
