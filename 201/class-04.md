# Writing Links
Links are created using the a element. Users can click on anything
between the opening a tag and the closing /a tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribut

## you can use linking (a) to :
- link to Other Sites
- link to Other Pages on the Same Site

### On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a website are sometimes referred to as directories.

## HOW TO do Opening Links in a New Window ????
If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
a tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.

## HOW can you do Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page ????
at first you have to a specific
part of a page, you need to
identify the points in the page
that the link will go to. You do
this using the id attribute (which
can be used on every HTML
element). To link to an element that uses
an id attribute you use the a
element again, but the value of
the href attribute starts with
the # symbol, followed by the
value of the id attribute of the
element you want to link to.

# Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

## Controlling the Position of Elements
CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property:
- Normal flow
- Relative Positioning
- Absolute positioning

To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom
and left or right it should be placed:
- Fixed Positioning
- Floating Elements

## Screen Sizes
Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.
## Screen Resolution
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

# WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements)
